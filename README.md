## Project Background  
As residential solar adoption increased, leadership sought to understand the extent of cost-shifting occurring under the existing rate structure. I was tasked with quantifying how much non-solar members were subsidizing solar members within the same rate class to guide equitable rate restructuring.

## Tools Used  
- **Excel** – Data analysis and cost-to-serve modeling  
- **PowerPoint** – Executive and regulatory presentation support  
- **MDM Portal** – Source for consumption and demand data

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Cost-of-service and subsidy analysis  
- Rate design and unbundling strategy  
- Data segmentation and interpretation  
- Alignment with cooperative principles

## Summary  
Using a sample of 100 randomly selected solar and non-solar residential members, I analyzed consumption, demand, billed revenue, and cost-to-serve. While solar members offset energy use through self-generation, their overall demand remained similar to non-solar members. Since credits for net generation were applied at the full retail rate—including embedded distribution and capacity costs—solar members avoided contributing to costs that remained fixed for the utility.

The findings supported leadership’s strategy to begin unbundling rates by introducing demand charges over a five-year period, shifting cost recovery away from volumetric energy charges. It also demonstrated the need for a full cost-of-service study to be approved in order to move forward with the rate plan the Chief Energy Resource Officer (CERO) would propose to the regulatory body.

## Key Takeaways  
- Quantified the financial impact of intra-class cost-shifting from solar to non-solar members under the current rate design  
- Demonstrated the urgency and justification for a full cost-of-service study before advancing major residential rate changes  
- Positioned leadership to propose a phased unbundling strategy, introducing demand charges to align cost recovery with cost causation

> “This analysis highlighted a critical and growing issue, giving leadership the evidence needed to justify a full cost-of-service study and advance the proposed rate strategy.”
